Program to simplify git for beginning users by streamlining standard cases.

As with Git for Windows, edge cases will require CLI work


TODO
----
0. Config file to handle other git servers besides Github
1. Automatically find all repos for the given user
2. Handle branches in push and pull
4. Make Gitupdate handle everything (update self, then push/pull as needed)

- Do it like Git for Windows - sync (pull, push as needed) plus branch options
- maybe "start" and "end" for sessions - start pulls, end commits and pushes?
- or "download" for pulling, "upload" for commit-push
